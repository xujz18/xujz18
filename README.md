### Hi, welcome to my Github 👋

I am Jiazheng Xu, a fourth-year PhD student in Tsinghua University.

- 🔭 Interested in multimodal generative models, especially RLHF and alignment. Find my up-to-date publication list in [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7--T2_4AAAAJ)!
- 🌱 Some of my proud leading works about RLHF for multimodal generative models:
  * [ImageReward (NeurIPS'23)](https://github.com/THUDM/ImageReward): the first general-purpose text-to-image human preference reward model (RM) for RLHF, outperforming CLIP/BLIP/Aesthetic by 30% in terms of human preference prediction.
  * [VisionReward (AAAI'26)](https://github.com/THUDM/VisionReward): a fine-grained and multi-dimensional reward model for image and video generation, outperforming VideoScore by 17.2% and enabling multi-objective optimization.
- 🌱 I'm also honored to work with the team on multimodal foundation models:
  * [CogVLM (NeurIPS'24)](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM): a powerful open-source visual language model (VLM), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 10 classic cross-modal benchmarks.
  * [CogAgent (CVPR'24)](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM): a visual agent being able to return a plan, next action, and specific operations with coordinates for any given task on any GUI screenshot, enhancing GUI-related question-answering capabilities.
  * [CogVideoX (ICLR'25)](https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo): a large-scale diffusion transformer models designed for generating videos based on text prompts.
- 💬 Feel free to drop me an email for:
  * Any form of collaboration
  * Any issue about my works or code
  * Interesting ideas to discuss or just chatting
